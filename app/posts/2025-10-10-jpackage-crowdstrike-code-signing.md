I wrote a [small terminal agent called Gus](https://github.com/carimura/gus) in Java named after one of my dogs (the big one) to play around with building agents and using tools and stuff. I might rename it to arc but that's my [static site generator](https://chad.cm/posts/2025-05-28-building-arc). I think the name arc is cooler, whereas Gus is more for loafing around with the chickens and looking homeless. I digress.

I discovered the hard way that because CrowdStrike is installed on my machine, I couldn't run apps built with `jpackage`, which is Java's packaging tool to bundle a runtime with your app and produce a native package. I use this for command-line stuff in Java. Like Arc. And Gus. Everything was fine on my home machine. Until they met my work machine. CrowdStrike would kill my app and quarantine the executable file. I'm guessing our IT group will provide an exception for me, but I felt like learning more so I dove in.

This blog post is for me, so I can repeat this.

## The Problem

The problem is because running a jpackage-built app results in the process being killed immediately:

```bash
./output/Hello.app/Contents/MacOS/Hello
[1]    30464 killed     ./output/Hello.app/Contents/MacOS/Hello
```

CrowdStrike Falcon quarantines the executable because of a file called `libjli.dylib`, which by default with jpackage is an "ad-hoc" signed binary (`codesign -s -`). Apparently this isn't very trustworthy. Like Gus himself. The real Gus has been licking his lips around the baby chickens. The protector becomes the aggressor.

## The Solution

### 1. Get an Apple Developer Certificate

Once enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, you need to create a **Developer ID Application** certificate (not "Apple Development" or "Mac App Distribution"). This is specifically for signing apps distributed outside the Mac App Store.

### 2. Create a Certificate Signing Request

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout DeveloperID.key \
  -out CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest \
  -subj "/emailAddress=you@example.com/CN=Your Name/C=US"
```

Upload the `.certSigningRequest` file to Apple Developer portal, select G2 Sub-CA, and download the resulting `.cer` file.

### 3. Import the Certificate

```bash
# Import the certificate
security import developerID_application.cer -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db

# Import the private key
security import DeveloperID.key -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db

# Download and import Apple's intermediate certificate
curl -O https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/DeveloperIDG2CA.cer
security import DeveloperIDG2CA.cer -k ~/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db

# Verify it's available
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

You should see your Developer ID Application identity listed.

### 4. Create an Entitlements File

The JVM requires specific entitlements to run with hardened runtime:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-jit</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
    <true/>
    <key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Save this as `entitlements.plist`.

### 5. Build and Sign with jpackage

```bash
jpackage \
  --name Hello \
  --type app-image \
  --input /path/to/input \
  --main-jar Hello.jar \
  --dest /path/to/output \
  --runtime-image /path/to/runtime \
  --mac-sign \
  --mac-signing-key-user-name "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
  --verbose
```

If jpackage doesn't apply entitlements correctly, manually re-sign:

```bash
codesign --force --sign "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
  --entitlements entitlements.plist \
  --deep --options runtime \
  output/Hello.app
```

### 6. Verify the Signature

```bash
codesign -dv output/Hello.app/Contents/MacOS/Hello
codesign -d --entitlements - --xml output/Hello.app/Contents/MacOS/Hello
```

You should see your Developer ID signature and the entitlements listed.

## Boom

```bash
‚ùØ ./output/Hello.app/Contents/MacOS/Hello
Hello, Chad
```

Boom.
