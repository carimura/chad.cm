I'm thrilled to finally launch my new personal website! This has been a project long in the making, and I'm excited to share it with you.

## Why a New Site?

My previous site was getting a bit long in the tooth, and I wanted something that was:

- **Fast** - Static sites load quickly and are easy to cache
- **Simple** - No complex databases or server-side processing
- **Maintainable** - Easy to update and extend
- **Mine** - Built with my own tools to my exact preferences

## Built with Arc

This site is built with [Arc](https://github.com/chadarimura/arc), a simple static site generator I've been developing. It's designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to use. Some key features include:

- Markdown-based content
- Simple template system
- Built-in development server
- Fast build times

## What to Expect

I'll be using this space to share:

- Technical tutorials and how-tos
- Project updates and announcements
- Thoughts on technology and software development
- Occasional personal updates

## Get in Touch

I'd love to hear your thoughts on the new site! You can reach me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chadarimura) or via [email](mailto:chad@chadarimura.com).

Thanks for visiting!
