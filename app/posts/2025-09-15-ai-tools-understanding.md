As I use AI tools to solve little time-consuming things, I find myself becoming less and less aware of how those things work under the hood. A simple example would be for maintaining our Inside.java site. I am an infrequent editor, so when I make changes, I forget where everything is in the layout. Now I never need to relearn. I suppose this is a good thing as I then can spend more time on higher leverage things, but it does raise a yellow flag in my brain that craves understanding the inner workings of everything.

In fact, even this post itself, although 100% written by me (I just can't use AI tools to write for me, the style bothers me beyond belief), I just asked an agent to go and find my blog in my projects tree and add a post. It's even using the static site generator I created myself. What a world. Cats and dogs living together.
