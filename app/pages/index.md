Hi my name is Chad Arimura.

I wanted to write a blog post about some OpenCV stuff I did in Java using the [Foreign Function & Memory API](https://dev.java/learn/ffm/), but then realized, I didn't have a blog. 

Since I work on the team that makes the Java Platform, I couldn't bare using some Javascript blog engine, so I [built my own in Java](https://github.com/carimura/arc). The code is like Stackoverflow and Baeldung got put in a blender then blown up with dynamite, but it works, and I got to play around with Cursor and Claude 4.
