Hi, my name is [Chad Arimura](/about.html). 

I am a 3x entrepreneur, most recently co-founder and CEO of [Iron.io](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iron-io) where we grew a multi-million dollar ARR business helping pioneer serverless computing including some of the earliest usages of the term "serverless". Now I lead the Developer Relations and Education groups for the Java team at Oracle.
