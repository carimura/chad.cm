Hi my name is Chad Arimura.

I am a 3x entrepreneur, most recently as co-founder and CEO of [Iron.io](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/iron-io) where we grew a multi-million dollar ARR business helping pioneer serverless computing including some of the earliest usages of the term "serverless" in 2010. Thanks to Ken Fromm for coining and pushing it! We sold the company in 2017 and joined Oracle.

On joining Oracle as Vice President of Serverless, I established the serverless organization, which produced [The Fn Project](http://fnproject.io) and later [Oracle Functions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianbridgwater/2019/08/06/oracle-extends-serverless-strategy-to-combat-cloud-complexity), making Oracle one of the only major clouds to offer a functions-as-a-service platform largely built on upstream open source code. Once the serverless org was fully established, I [moved to the Java Platform Group](https://medium.com/@carimura/image-processing-in-java-1e468c92c216) to help build out the developer relations and "Java in Education" teams.

Since joining the Java Developer Relations team, we've launched [Dev.java](https://dev.java), [Inside.java](https://inside.java), a successful [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/java), and a group focused on ensuring Java remains part of the education system globally.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chadarimura) but as you can see I'm not very active anymore. I used to write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@carimura). Coding will always be close to my heart when I get the chance, code at [GitHub](https://github.com/carimura).

I'm married to the amazing [Sarah Arimura](http://www.sarahswangler.com/), dad to 3 kiddos, boss of a few dogs, and commander and chief to something like 18 chickens.
