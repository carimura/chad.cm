# Chad.cm Project Rules

## Project Structure
- The `chad.cm/` directory contains the website source and generated output
  - `chad.cm/app/` - Source files (markdown, templates, assets, configs)
  - `chad.cm/site/` - **GENERATED OUTPUT - DO NOT EDIT** (regenerated by arc)

## Important Rules

### 1. Never Edit Generated Files
- **NEVER** modify files in `chad.cm/site/` directory
- All changes should be made to source files in `chad.cm/app/`
- The `site/` folder is completely regenerated when arc runs

### 2. Running Arc
- After building, run arc from the project root to generate the site
- Arc processes files from `chad.cm/app/` and outputs to `chad.cm/site/`

### 3. File Types
- Content: Markdown files (`.md`) in `app/pages/` and `app/posts/`
- Templates: HTML files in `app/templates/`
- Assets: CSS, JS, images in `app/assets/`
- Config: `app/site.config` for site configuration

## Development Workflow
1. Make changes to source files in `chad.cm/app/`
2. Run `arc --watch` to regenerate the site and watch for changes
4. Generated files appear in `chad.cm/site/`
4. For viewing the site, `cd site; jwebserver`
